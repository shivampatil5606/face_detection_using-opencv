# face_detection_using-opencv


This is a simple Face Detection web app.Here it just detects the faces in the given image. I am using flask as it is convenient and very handy. Here the user can upload the image and it gets stored in a folder called uploads. Then the model detects the faces in the uploaded image and stores the result in prediction folder.

<br/><br/><br/>

To use the code download the zip file and unzip it.Then open command prompt and go to the folder location.

<br/>

Create an environment using following command.
```python
py -m venv env
```

Now we can activate the environment using the following command
```python
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Now we have to install all the required pakages. So run the following command.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now we are ready to go. Just type following command. 
```python
python app.py
```

We will now copy the Url (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) given to us and paste it in browser.










I have not designed the web page much. You can do it to your liking. I ahve already given CSS and JS files from Bootstrap.
